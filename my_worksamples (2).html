			<h3>Work Sample: Quick Quiz Android App</h3>
			<p>As an assignment for my Android Development course, I was asked to create an app that took a .txt file containing a comma-separated list of questions and answers and transform it into a
			multiple-choice quiz that allows the user to choose the correct answer to a question from a randomly-generated list of responses. The app also keeps track of the user name, number of questions
			remaining in the quiz, and the user's current score.
			
			This app required a broad range of Android knowledge, from using hashmaps to create the required collection of answers and questions to creating intents to carry user info between activities. Ensuring that the
			selection of possible answers was random enough while still containing the correct answer required some creative use of the shuffle() function and various arrays. Looking at it now, the code seems
			simple, but at the time I was very proud of making it work with (what I thought was) such elegant code.
			
			Creativity is important when working in Android, both for thinking about the logic of the program and for designing the UI. I am pretty pleased with the color palette of this app, but in the future I would like
			to smooth out the rest of the UI. Better buttons and a more interesting scoring layout would really improve this app, and might make the palette pop even more.
